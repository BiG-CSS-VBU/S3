STR Seed Selection Algorithm
Short Tandem Repeats(STR) are the repeatition of short DNA motif ranging in 1 to 6 nt 
in tandem over the genomes of complex organisms. STRs are well studied for their wide-
-ranging significance in various applications. Identification of STR loci in long DNA
sequences are vital for the applications in the area of genetic linkage analysis, DNA
profiling for cancer diagonis, kinsap analysis etc.
In this repository we have uploaded two files(including this).
1. README.md (this file)
2. s3( the executable)
*************************************************************************************
The following section will describe how to use the executable to extract STR loci from
DNA sequences.
